### Hi, This is My Python Streamlit and Data Analytics Learning Playground

I am Atul Bhardwaj, a dedicated and results-driven professional with a Master's degree in Computer Applications from Gautam Buddha University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from G.L Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management.

With a strong foundation in software development, data analytics, and front-end technologies, I have worked in dynamic environments like Kalkine Consultancy India Private Limited, where I contributed to optimizing web platforms and enhancing user experiences.

I am proficient in Java, Python, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, and other related technologies.

Here, I am learning by doing hands-on projects where I apply data analytics skills to track, compare, and visualize stock market trends. These projects enhance my analytical thinking and provide real-time insights into financial markets, further solidifying my skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization tools.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am well-versed in Agile environments and continuously strive to improve my knowledge through various internships, courses, and certifications.

With a keen interest in data analytics, software development, and a proactive learning approach, I aim to leverage my skills to contribute effectively in a challenging and growth-oriented role.

**ENJOY!!!**
