### Hi, This is My Python StreamLit and data Analytics Learning Playground
I am Atul Bhardwaj, a dedicated and results-driven professional with a Master's degree in Computer Applications from Gautam Buddha University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from G.L Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management. With a strong foundation in software development, data analytics, and front-end technologies, I have worked in dynamic environments like Kalkine Consultancy India Private Limited, where I contributed to optimizing web platforms and enhancing user experiences. I am proficient in Java, Python, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MySql, and other related technologies.

Here, I am learning by doing hands-on projects,  where I applied data analytics skills to track, compare, and visualize stock market trends. These projects enhanced my analytical thinking and provided real-time insights into financial markets, further solidifying my skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization tools. In addition to my technical expertise, I am well-versed in Agile environments and continuously strive to improve my knowledge through various internships, courses, and certifications.

With a keen interest in data analytics, software development, and a proactive learning approach, I aim to leverage my skills to contribute effectively in a challenging and growth-oriented role ENJOY!!!.
